# Welcome to cLabs DevRel Repo!
This private repository will be used to provide updates to documentation, project work, and general support for the wider Celo developer communities that DevRel supports.

## DevRel Mission 
The Developer Relations team aims to support and grow an open and inviting developer community and ecosystem focused on supporting and inspiring developers to build on the Celo Platform. 

Developer Relations will work to showcase the Celo Platformâ€™s key benefits like a lightweight mobile client infrastructure and Ethereum network compatibility. 

The team will also work to produce and maintain a quality developer experience through high quality technical documentation, ergonomic tooling, and a suite of examples and tutorials that help developers save time and effort and enable building and launching their projects quickly and safely (good security defaults).

## Purpose: developer adoption
DevRel utilizes the Celo community to obtain data necessary to produce materials to ensure the community has proper resources to utilize the Celo blockchain platform. 

DevRel provides community support through **education**, **community support**, and **Events** to foster Celo platform **adoption**.
