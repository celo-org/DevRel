# Welcome to the DevRel Repo!
This repo helps organize community projects, events, documentation, and educational material.

## DevRel Mission 
The Developer Relations team aims to support and grow an open and inviting developer community and ecosystem focused on supporting and inspiring developers to build on the Celo Platform. 

Developer Relations will work to showcase the Celo Platformâ€™s key benefits like a lightweight mobile client infrastructure and Ethereum network compatibility. 

The team will also work to produce and maintain a quality developer experience through high quality technical documentation, ergonomic tooling, and a suite of examples and tutorials that help developers save time and effort and enable building and launching their projects quickly and safely (good security defaults).

## What does DevRel do?
Developer Relations involves a lot more than writing code.

DevRel is:
- building relationships and fostering trust
- collecting and relaying feedback to other teams
- helping people work through challenges
- inspiring people to build
- building tools to empower
- mentorship
